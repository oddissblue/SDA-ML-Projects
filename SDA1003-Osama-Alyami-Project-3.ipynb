Using techniques like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score, we determined that K=5 provided the best clustering results.\n","\n","3. **Visualization:** We visualized the clusters in a 3D space, allowing us to see how customers from different clusters are distributed based on age, annual income, and spending score.\n","\n","4. **Cluster Analysis:** We analyzed the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into customer behavior. This information can be used to tailor marketing campaigns and services to specific customer segments.\n","\n","5. **Hierarchical Clustering:** In addition to K-Means, we performed Hierarchical Clustering based on annual income and spending score. This approach provided further segmentation possibilities.\n","\n","6. **Optimal Number of Clusters:** We used dendrograms to determine the optimal number of clusters, finding that K=3 provided a meaningful segmentation."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
